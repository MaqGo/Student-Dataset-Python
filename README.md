# 📊 Student-Dataset-Python
Welcome! This repository contains my Day 3 practice notebook for learning Pandas, the powerful Python library for data analysis. This notebook demonstrates how to install Pandas, check the version, and create simple DataFrames from dictionaries.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

This project includes two Jupyter/Colab notebooks:

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Day 1** | Covers the basics: installing Pandas, creating Series & DataFrames, loading CSV files, inspecting data, and basic operations. |
| **Day 3** | Builds on Day 1: more DataFrame manipulations, creating DataFrames from dictionaries, basic statistics, and version checking. |
